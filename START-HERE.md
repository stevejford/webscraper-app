# 🚀 START HERE - Your Web Scraper is Ready!

## ✅ Setup Status
- [x] Database schema applied to Supabase
- [x] OpenAI API key configured
- [x] Environment files ready
- [x] All dependencies configured

## 🎯 Quick Start (2 Commands)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# Backend (requires Bun - install from https://bun.sh if needed)
cd ../backend-bun
bun install
```

### Step 2: Start Both Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend-bun
bun run dev

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Your Application URLs

Once both services are running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/health

## 🧪 First Tests to Try

### 1. **Health Check** (Verify Backend)
Open: http://localhost:3001/health
Expected: `{"status": "healthy", "database": "connected"}`

### 2. **Frontend Interface** (Verify Frontend)
Open: http://localhost:5173
Expected: Clean dashboard with API key status banner

### 3. **Settings Configuration** (Test Integration)
1. Click "Configure" or go to Settings
2. Navigate to "API Configuration" tab
3. Your OpenAI key should validate automatically
4. Try other settings tabs

### 4. **Database Connection** (Verify Supabase)
Check your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jeymatvbyfaxhxztbjsw/editor)
Expected: All tables visible with data

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Backend Won't Start**
```bash
# Check if Bun is installed
bun --version

# If not installed:
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
# Then restart terminal and try again
```

### **Frontend Won't Start**
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Database Connection Issues**
1. Check [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jeymatvbyfaxhxztbjsw)
2. Verify project is active
3. Check if schema was applied correctly

### **CORS Errors**
- Make sure backend is running on port 3001
- Frontend should be on port 5173
- Check browser console for specific errors

## 📋 Success Checklist

You'll know everything is working when:
- [ ] Backend logs show: "Server running on http://localhost:3001"
- [ ] Frontend loads without console errors
- [ ] Health check returns "healthy"
- [ ] Settings page loads and saves preferences
